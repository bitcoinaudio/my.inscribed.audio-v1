# Royalty Kit Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented the Royalty Kit functionality to automatically populate PSBT fields when a user selects an inscription and confirms a royalty fee. The system now retrieves UTXO information using LaserEyes and builds the necessary PSBT for royalty-enforced transactions.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated RoyaltyKit.jsx

#### Added LaserEyes Methods
- Added `getUtxos` and `signPsbt` to the LaserEyes hook destructuring
- These methods are essential for retrieving wallet UTXOs and signing PSBTs

#### New Helper Functions
- **`findInscriptionUtxo(inscriptionId)`**: Locates the UTXO containing the selected inscription
  - First tries to match by parsing the inscription ID to extract the txid
  - Falls back to finding UTXOs with common ordinal values (777 or 546 sats)
  - Last resort: uses the smallest UTXO as it's likely the inscription
  - Includes comprehensive error handling

- **`findFundingUtxo(excludeOutpoint)`**: Finds a suitable funding UTXO
  - Excludes the inscription UTXO from selection
  - Prefers UTXOs with at least 10,000 sats for fees and royalty
  - Falls back to any available UTXO if large ones aren't found
  - Provides clear error messages for debugging

#### Enhanced `handleConfirmRoyalty` Function
- Now automatically populates all PSBT fields when user confirms royalty fee
- Retrieves inscription and funding UTXOs using the helper functions
- Sets the form fields: `ordinalInput`, `ordinalValue`, `fundingInput`, `fundingValue`, `royaltyAmount`
- Provides clear status updates during the process
- Closes the modal and shows the populated form for user review

#### Improved `handleCreatePSBT` Function
- Added validation to ensure all fields are populated before proceeding
- Implemented proper PSBT signing using LaserEyes `signPsbt` method
- Added comprehensive error handling for signing and broadcasting
- Uses testnet mempool API for transaction broadcasting
- Provides clear status updates throughout the process

#### UI Improvements
- Added visual indicator when all PSBT fields are populated
- Updated instruction text to guide users through the new workflow
- Enhanced status messages for better user experience

### 2. Updated RoyaltyConfirmModal.tsx
- Fixed layout issues with duplicate input fields
- Simplified the preview section 
- Improved modal structure and user experience
- Added estimated fee calculation display

## Workflow

### User Experience Flow
1. **Connect Wallet**: User connects their wallet via LaserEyes
2. **Select Inscription**: User browses their inscriptions in the carousel
3. **Set Royalty Fee**: User clicks on an inscription and sets the desired royalty fee
4. **Auto-Population**: System automatically finds the inscription UTXO and a funding UTXO
5. **Review Fields**: All PSBT creation fields are populated automatically
6. **Create Transaction**: User clicks "Create Listing & Sign" to build and sign the PSBT
7. **Broadcast**: System broadcasts the signed transaction to the network

### Technical Flow
1. `handleSelectInscription()` → Opens confirmation modal
2. `handleConfirmRoyalty()` → Calls `findInscriptionUtxo()` and `findFundingUtxo()`
3. Form fields auto-populate with UTXO information
4. `handleCreatePSBT()` → Calls backend `/api/create-psbt` endpoint
5. LaserEyes signs the PSBT
6. Transaction broadcasts to mempool

## Backend Integration

The implementation integrates with the existing Rust backend endpoints:

### `/api/create-psbt`
- Takes ordinal and funding UTXO information
- Creates a royalty-enforced PSBT
- Returns base64-encoded PSBT for signing

### `/api/create-royalty-asset` 
- Creates royalty asset metadata
- Associates royalty terms with inscription
- Returns PSBT for royalty asset creation

## Error Handling

Comprehensive error handling covers:
- Missing wallet connection
- No UTXOs found in wallet
- Insufficient funds for fees
- UTXO parsing errors
- PSBT creation failures
- Signing cancellation by user
- Network broadcasting errors

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
1. **Multi-wallet Support**: Handle different wallet types with specific UTXO retrieval methods
2. **Advanced UTXO Selection**: More sophisticated algorithms for optimal UTXO selection
3. **Fee Estimation**: Dynamic fee calculation based on network conditions
4. **Transaction History**: Track and display previous royalty transactions
5. **Batch Operations**: Support for processing multiple inscriptions at once

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Start the Rust backend: `cargo run` in the ordinals-royalty-rust-gemini directory
2. Start the frontend: `npm run dev` in the my.inscribed.audio-v1 directory
3. Connect a wallet with inscriptions and UTXOs
4. Select an inscription and follow the workflow

The system should automatically populate PSBT fields and allow for seamless transaction creation and signing.
