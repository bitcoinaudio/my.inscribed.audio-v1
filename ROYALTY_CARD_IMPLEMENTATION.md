# Bitcoin Royalty Card Implementation

## Overview

We have successfully implemented a comprehensive royalty card system for displaying and managing royalty-enabled ordinal listings. This implementation follows the design principles from `BitcoinRoyalty.html` and creates a marketplace-ready display system.

## Components Created

### 1. RoyaltyCard Component (`src/components/RoyaltyCard.jsx`)

A reusable React component that displays royalty-enabled ordinal inscriptions with the following features:

#### Features:
- **Multi-media support**: Images, text, audio, video, and other content types
- **Responsive design**: Follows the BitcoinRoyalty.html aesthetic with dark theme
- **Detailed asset information**: Shows inscription ID, content type, artist, royalty details
- **PSBT transaction details**: Displays transaction information when available
- **Marketplace ready**: Includes purchase button functionality for marketplace listings
- **Interactive elements**: Clickable links to ord server, formatted satoshi amounts

#### Props:
- `inscription`: The inscription object with ID and content type
- `royaltyAmount`: Amount of royalty in satoshis
- `royaltyKey`: The Bitcoin address that receives royalties
- `artist`: Artist name (defaults to "Unknown")
- `description`: Description of the artwork
- `psbtData`: Transaction details object
- `onPurchase`: Callback function for purchase actions
- `showPurchaseButton`: Boolean to show/hide purchase button
- `isListing`: Boolean to indicate if this is a marketplace listing

### 2. RoyaltyMarketplace Component (`src/components/RoyaltyMarketplace.jsx`)

A marketplace interface for browsing royalty-enabled listings that follows the Bitcoin Royalty Kit design:

#### Features:
- **Consistent Design**: Matches RoyaltyKit's dark theme, header style, and card layout
- **Reusable Components**: Uses same Card and Button components as RoyaltyKit
- **Header Design**: Identical header with Bitcoin Royalty logo and red accent colors
- **Filtering system**: Filter by content type (images, audio, text, all) using RoyaltyKit styling
- **Sorting options**: Sort by price (low to high, high to low) or most recent
- **Responsive grid**: Displays listings in a responsive grid layout
- **Create Listing CTA**: Prominent "Create Listing" buttons linking back to RoyaltyKit
- **Navigation Integration**: Back links and forward links between marketplace and creation tool
- **How It Works Section**: Styled information card explaining the royalty system

### 3. MarketplaceDemo Page (`src/pages/MarketplaceDemo.jsx`)

A demonstration page showing how the marketplace would look with sample data:

#### Features:
- **Mock listings**: Includes sample royalty-enabled inscriptions
- **Live demo**: Shows how the marketplace would function
- **Purchase simulation**: Demonstrates purchase flow (currently shows alert)

## Integration with RoyaltyKit

### Enhanced RoyaltyKit.jsx Features:

1. **Dynamic listing preview**: The "Your Royalty Listing" section now shows a live preview using RoyaltyCard
2. **Success flow**: After creating a PSBT successfully, users see their listing preview
3. **Reset functionality**: Users can create new listings after completing one
4. **Navigation integration**: Direct link to marketplace demo when listing is created

### State Management:
- Added `listingCreated` state to track when a listing has been successfully created
- Enhanced the UI to show different states (empty, preview, completed)
- Added reset functionality to clear all fields and start over

## Navigation Updates

- Added "Marketplace Demo" to the main navigation (`src/components/NavBar.jsx`)
- Added route for marketplace demo in `src/App.jsx`
- Added contextual link from RoyaltyKit to marketplace demo

## User Flow

### Creating a Royalty Listing:
1. User connects wallet
2. Selects an inscription from the carousel or enters manually
3. System auto-populates PSBT fields using ord server data
4. User sets royalty amount and creates PSBT
5. User signs transaction in wallet
6. Transaction is broadcast to Bitcoin network
7. **New**: User sees their listing preview in the RoyaltyCard format
8. User can view marketplace demo or create new listing

### Marketplace Experience:
1. Users can browse royalty-enabled listings
2. Filter by content type and sort by various criteria
3. Each listing shows complete details including royalty information
4. Purchase buttons are ready for future PSBT-based purchasing flow

## Design Consistency

The marketplace implementation now perfectly follows the Bitcoin Royalty Kit design language:

### Visual Consistency:
- **Identical Header**: Same Bitcoin Royalty logo, title styling, and subtitle format
- **Matching Color Palette**: Red accent colors (#ef4444) throughout instead of generic marketplace colors
- **Consistent Cards**: Same Card component with gray-700 borders and backdrop-blur
- **Button Styling**: Identical button components with red backgrounds and hover states
- **Typography**: Same font weights, sizes, and text color hierarchy

### Layout Consistency:
- **Grid System**: Three-column responsive grid matching RoyaltyKit layout
- **Spacing**: Identical padding, margins, and gap sizes between elements
- **Component Structure**: Same header → main → cards → footer structure as RoyaltyKit

### Navigation Flow:
- **Seamless Transition**: Users can move between creation (RoyaltyKit) and browsing (Marketplace) smoothly
- **Contextual Links**: "Create Listing" buttons prominently placed in marketplace
- **Back Navigation**: Clear path back to RoyaltyKit from marketplace demo

This ensures users experience a cohesive, professional interface whether they're creating or browsing royalty listings.

### Content Type Handling:
The RoyaltyCard intelligently renders different content types:
- **Images**: Direct image display with fallback
- **Text**: Embedded iframe for text content
- **Audio**: HTML5 audio player
- **Video**: HTML5 video player
- **Other**: Fallback with content type info and direct link

### Styling:
- **Consistent Design Language**: Marketplace follows the exact same design as RoyaltyKit
- **Shared Components**: Uses same Card, Button, and header components for consistency  
- **Color Scheme**: Red accent colors (#ef4444) instead of yellow, matching RoyaltyKit theme
- **Dark Theme**: Follows the BitcoinRoyalty.html dark theme with gray-900 backgrounds
- **Typography**: Consistent font sizing and spacing with RoyaltyKit
- **Layout Grid**: Responsive grid system matching the RoyaltyKit three-column layout
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover states and transitions consistent with RoyaltyKit buttons

### Data Integration:
- Uses real inscription data from the ord server
- Formats satoshi amounts for better readability
- Shows Bitcoin amounts in both sats and BTC
- Links to actual ord server pages for verification

## Future Marketplace Development

This implementation provides the foundation for a full marketplace:

1. **PSBT-based purchasing**: The purchase buttons can be connected to PSBT creation for buyers
2. **Listing management**: Artists can manage their royalty-enabled listings
3. **Royalty tracking**: Built-in royalty information for automatic enforcement
4. **Search and discovery**: Enhanced filtering and search capabilities

## Files Modified/Created:

### New Files:
- `src/components/RoyaltyCard.jsx` - Main royalty card component
- `src/components/RoyaltyMarketplace.jsx` - Marketplace interface
- `src/pages/MarketplaceDemo.jsx` - Demo page with sample data

### Modified Files:
- `src/pages/RoyaltyKit.jsx` - Enhanced with RoyaltyCard integration
- `src/components/NavBar.jsx` - Added marketplace demo link
